Hard Hants Wanted

### Purpose of README
This document will contain design, architecture, and other major project decisions made along the way for reference to whoever takes up the project.

### Requirements / Product Priorities
- Simple
- Cheap
- Functional

Our goal is to to achieve these basic requirements while still creating an architecture that is extensible beyond an MVP.
We will use *Django*, which will allow us to initially build a simplified full stack web application that serves out static web pages initially. If the project grows in scope, Django's flexibility will allow us to convert it into a REST API Framework that can exclusively become the backend, if we need to have dynamic frontend pages using React or another frontend library.
